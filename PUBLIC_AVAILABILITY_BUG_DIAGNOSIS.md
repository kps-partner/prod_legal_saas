# ðŸš¨ PUBLIC AVAILABILITY BUG DIAGNOSIS

## Problem Summary
**User Issue**: Availability settings show Tuesday as "Not available" but the booking page still displays Tuesday time slots.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Architecture Discovery
- **Public Booking Page**: `frontend/src/app/intake/[firmId]/page.tsx` calls `apiClient.getPublicAvailability(firmId)`
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/v1/public/availability/{firmId}` in `backend/app/modules/public/router.py`
- **Service Function**: `get_firm_availability(firm_id)` in `backend/app/modules/public/services.py`

### 2. Critical Finding
The `get_firm_availability()` function on line 232 calls:
```python
available_slots = get_calendar_availability(firm_id, days=60)
```

This is the **SAME** function I previously fixed in `backend/app/modules/scheduling/services.py`. However, the issue persists because:

### 3. Database Investigation Results
```
Availability settings count: 1
Firm Another Test Firm: HAS settings
Firm Final Test Firm: NO settings  
Firm Test Firm 75u5uc: NO settings
```

**Key Discovery**: Most firms don't have availability settings configured in the database!

### 4. The Real Problem
When a firm has NO availability settings in the database:
- The `get_calendar_availability()` function falls back to default behavior
- It generates slots for ALL days without checking weekly schedule restrictions
- This explains why disabled days still show slots

### 5. Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected**: 
- Settings show Tuesday DISABLED â†’ Booking page shows NO Tuesday slots

**Actual**:
- Settings show Tuesday DISABLED â†’ Booking page STILL shows Tuesday slots
- This happens because the availability settings aren't being properly applied

## Diagnosis Status: CONFIRMED BUG

### 6. Multiple Possible Sources Identified

1. **Missing Availability Settings**: Firms without settings get default "all days enabled" behavior
2. **Settings Not Applied**: Even with settings, the weekly schedule filtering might not work properly
3. **Calendar Override**: Google Calendar integration might override weekly schedule settings
4. **Timezone Issues**: Settings might be in different timezone than slot generation
5. **Database Query Issues**: Settings lookup might be failing silently

### 7. Most Likely Root Causes (Narrowed Down)

**Primary Suspect**: The `get_calendar_availability()` function doesn't properly handle the case where availability settings exist but weekly schedule filtering fails.

**Secondary Suspect**: Missing or incomplete availability settings in the database for most firms.

## Next Steps Required

1. **Test with firm that HAS settings** to confirm if the bug reproduces
2. **Add diagnostic logging** to trace exactly where the weekly schedule filtering fails
3. **Fix the filtering logic** to ensure disabled days are properly excluded
4. **Validate the fix** with the user's specific scenario

## Files Involved
- `backend/app/modules/public/services.py` (public availability endpoint)
- `backend/app/modules/scheduling/services.py` (core availability logic)
- `frontend/src/app/intake/[firmId]/page.tsx` (booking page)
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` (API client)

## Impact
- **Critical**: Clients can book appointments on days when the firm is not available
- **User Experience**: Confusing disconnect between settings and booking page
- **Business Logic**: Availability system not working as designed
